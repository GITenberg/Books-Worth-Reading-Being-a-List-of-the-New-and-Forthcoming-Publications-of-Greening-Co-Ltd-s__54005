<h2>GENERAL LITERATURE, CRITICISM,
POETRY, ETC.</h2>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">English Writers of To-Day:</span>
Being a Series of Monographs on living Authors.
The following are the first volumes in the Series:&mdash;</p>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Rudyard Kipling.</span> The Man and His Work. Being
an attempt at an “Appreciation.” By <span class="smcap">G. F. Monkshood</span>, Author
of “Woman and The Wits,” “My Lady Ruby,” etc. Containing
a portrait of Mr Kipling and an autograph letter to the author
in facsimile. A new and cheaper edition. Crown 8vo, cloth gilt,
3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Telegraph.</span>&mdash;“He writes fluently, and he has genuine enthusiasm for his subject,
and an intimate acquaintance with his work. Moreover, the book has been submitted
to Mr Kipling, whose characteristic letter to the author is set forth on the preface.…
Of Kipling’s heroes Mr Monkshood has a thorough understanding, and his remarks
on them are worth quoting” (extract follows).</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Globe.</span>&mdash;“It has at the basis of it both knowledge and enthusiasm&mdash;knowledge of the
works estimated and enthusiasm for them. This book may be accepted as a generous
exposition of Mr Kipling’s merits as a writer. We can well believe that it will have
many interested and approving readers.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Scotsman.</span>&mdash;“This well-informed volume is plainly sincere. It is thoroughly well
studied, and takes pains to answer all the questions that are usually put about Mr Kipling.
The writer’s enthusiasm carries both himself and his reader along in the most agreeable
style. One way and another his book is full of interest, and those who wish to talk
about Kipling will find it invaluable, while the thousands of his admirers will read it
through with delighted enthusiasm.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Bret Harte:</span> a Treatise and a Tribute. By <span class="smcap">T. Edgar
Pemberton</span>, Author of “The Kendals,” “Life of Sothern,” etc.,
with a new portrait of Mr Bret Harte and a Bibliography. Crown
8vo, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Spectator.</span>&mdash;“A highly interesting book.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Mail.</span>&mdash;“An interesting biography full of good things.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sunday Sun.</span>&mdash;“A pleasant and interesting memoir.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Whitehall Review.</span>&mdash;“a truly delightful book.… Written in no mean spirit of
adulation, it is a well-balanced, characteristic, and fair estimate of a personality and a
mind far above the average.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sunday Special.</span>&mdash;“It is an intensely interesting life story Mr Pemberton has to tell.…
This little volume is eminently readable, full of excellent stories and anecdotes,
and is in short a very admirable commentary upon the work of one of the brightest
masters of the pen that the great continent oversea has produced.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Express.</span>&mdash;“Every true lover of Bret Harte ought to get Mr T. Edgar
Pemberton’s book. There are not many authors, alas! that would bear study at close
range, but here certainly is one where knowledge of his early struggles and trials will
only increase our affection and interest in the man himself and his stories. Mr Pemberton
has shown in this book the qualities of an ideal biographer. His touch is light, his figure
stands clear, and we find in his work a strong human note we learned long years ago to
associate with the creator of M’Liss.”</p>

</div>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Algernon Charles Swinburne.</span> A Study. By
<span class="smcap">Theodore Wratislaw</span> (Dedicated to Theodore Watts-Dunton),
with a new portrait of Mr Swinburne and a Bibliography. Crown
8vo, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Daily News.</span>&mdash;“Mr Wratislaw’s work is always dignified and eloquent, and not without
critical acuteness.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Review of the Week.</span>&mdash;“It is not only a study, it is an entertainment. It has dignity
and no dulness.… Though an appreciation, it is not an exaggeration. The summing
up, though masterly, is not tyrannical. It is concise and sufficient, and is as artistically
written as artistically informed. Author and publisher have combined to make the book
one not only to peruse, but to possess. The price is more than moderate, the <i>format</i>
more than presentable.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Court Circular.</span>&mdash;“This little volume forms an excellent handbook to his (Swinburne’s)
writing. It is not simply an eulogy, but rather a discriminate appreciation and a loving
analysis of the poet’s works, which are dealt with chronologically as they were published.
The exposition helps greatly to elucidate many of the poems, and the criticisms are fair
and unbiassed. Those who know their Swinburne well will find a new pleasure in the
poems after reading this book, and those who have hitherto been deterred from studying
him are put in possession of a golden key to unlock the gateway of an enchanted garden.
Mr Wratislaw has fulfilled his task ably and well, and has earned the gratitude of all
lovers of English poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Weekly Sun</span> (T. P. O’Connor) says:&mdash;A Book of the Week&mdash;“I have found this slight
and unpretentious little volume bright, interesting reading. I have read nearly every
line with pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Illustrated London News.</span>&mdash;“The story Mr Scott has to tell is full of varied interest,
and is presented with warmth and buoyancy.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Punch.</span>&mdash;“What pleasant memories does not Clement Scott’s little book, ‘The Wheel
of Life,’ revive! The writer’s memory is good, his style easy, and above all, which is a
great thing for reminiscences, chatty.”</p>

Greening</span>. Crown 8vo, cloth gilt, 2s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Pilot.</span>&mdash;“This book will be eagerly read by all who, not having had an opportunity of
seeing this or that actor in the character, is anxious to know ‘how it was done.’”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Court Circular.</span>&mdash;“Interesting and valuable. Indeed it would be difficult to name
any better theatrical criticism. The style is nervous and vivid, and the critical acumen
displayed of a high order.… The criticisms are a valuable contribution to dramatic
literature, and will be read with great interest by all playgoers.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Glasgow Herald.</span>&mdash;“The dramatic critic’s vivid impressions and subtle analysis
enable us to compare the varied interpretations which dramatic genius have put upon
Shakespeare’s great creation. They will make interesting reading for the student as well
as the playgoer, for Mr Scott does not fail to note deviations from this or that text, and
departures from traditional ‘points’ and hackneyed effects.”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Observer.</span>&mdash;“The little book is bright and readable, and will come like a breath of
country air to many unfortunates who are tied by the leg to chair, stool, or counter.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Dundee Advertiser.</span>&mdash;“It is all delightful, and almost as good as a holiday. The
city clerk, the jaded shopman, the weary milliner, the pessimistic dyspeptic, should each
read the book. It will bring a suggestion of sea breezes, the plash of waves, and all the
accessories of a holiday by the sea.”</p>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">A Vagabond in Asia.</span> A Volume of Travel off
the Beaten Track. By <span class="smcap">Edmund Candler</span>. With Illustrations
from Photographs, and a Map showing the Author’s route.
Crown 8vo, cloth, 6s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Morning Post.</span>&mdash;“Brightly written and full of observation that throws vivid and
playful sidelights here and there, and provides entertainment that does not always
appertain to works of travel.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Express.</span>&mdash;“A delightful and intimate work.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sunday Special.</span>&mdash;“There is an intense enthusiasm, a poetic fervour, and a dry sense
of humour, such as you only find at intervals among books.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Outlook.</span>&mdash;“These records of <i>Reiselust</i>, or go-fever, as we may call them, are off the
beaten track, are novel, manly and picturesque.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Standard.</span>&mdash;“The book is written with humour, his impressions of men and places are
vivid, and the charm of the volume is heightened by illustrations, some of which bring
us face to face with typical natives of the East, whilst others afford fair glimpses of
tropical scenery.”</p>

</div>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Captain Mayne Reid:</span> His Life and Adventures.

and Illustrations. Crown 8vo, cloth gilt, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Graphic.</span>&mdash;“A fascinating work in which Captain Mayne Reid’s life is carefully
and sympathetically sketched.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">World.</span>&mdash;“The career of this popular writer was adventurous and thrilling, and Mrs
Mayne Reid tells in the most entertaining manner the literary history of her husband
and the eventful incidents of his career. Altogether it is a fascinating biography of an
interesting person.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Weekly Despatch.</span>&mdash;“A truly fascinating volume which should be read by everyone.”</p>

gilt, 5s.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Telegraph</span> (<span class="smcap">W. L. Courtney</span>) says:&mdash;“It is a wonderful book that Mr
Downing has written, and no brief analysis could do it adequate justice.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Review of the Week.</span>&mdash;“It is a very remarkable book, and the ideas set forth in it
are startlingly original.… The man who is not moved to think deeply after reading
this book must indeed be ‘dead to the soul.’ In a style that is beautiful in its simplicity,
Clelia works out his conclusions with marvellous skill.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Westminster Review.</span>&mdash;“Contains much sound criticism of a new and daring
kind.… The book should be read by all Shakspearean students.”</p>

“The Messiahship of Shakspeare.” Crown 8vo, cloth, 6s.</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Glasgow Herald.</span>&mdash;“A knowledge of Shakspeare unrivalled except by Mr Swinburne.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Scotsman.</span>&mdash;“Really profound insight. Keen and clever analysis.”</p>

Profusely Illustrated with Examples of Poster Work by the
famous Poster Artists of the day. 4to, cloth, 7s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Sketch.</span>&mdash;“A complete and valuable work upon an important and interesting subject.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">St James’s Gazette.</span>&mdash;“A large and handsome book. Well written and beautifully
illustrated.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Whitehall Review.</span>&mdash;“The way Mr Rogers has done his work is a testimonial at once
to his knowledge and a monument to his taste. This very handsome volume … is
worthy of a place in anybody’s library.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Bookman.</span>&mdash;“An interesting and valuable book for all interested in poster work and
poster collections. The illustrations are thoroughly representative and excellently
produced.”</p>

from the Marquis of Lorne reproduced in facsimile. Crown 8vo,
cloth, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Chronicle.</span>&mdash;“We take pleasure in commending the book because of its freshness
and genuine excellence. Mr Taber has undoubtedly struck what is a virgin soil so
far as fiction is concerned. The local colour of the story is novel&mdash;so novel, in fact, as
to give quite an unusual interest and value to the book.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Umpire</span> (Book of the Week).&mdash;“Mr Taber has the gift of story-telling, and he has the
peculiar satisfaction of being first in an entirely new field. There is undoubted
fascination in his pages.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Outlook.</span>&mdash;“Well written and decidedly entertaining. It is to be hoped that Mr Taber
may produce another series of characteristic stories, as direct in their appeal to the
sympathy as are these.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Literature.</span>&mdash;“Fresh and uncommon. Mr Taber really gets the Arctic atmosphere
and feeling into his work.”</p>

</div>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Woman:</span> A Study and Defence. Adapted from the
French of <span class="smcap">Alfred Fouillée</span> by the Rev. <span class="smcap">T. A. Seed</span>. Crown

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Review of the Week.</span>&mdash;“An interesting little book. The scientific arguments are
lucidly and convincingly put.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sunday Special.</span>&mdash;“There is much curious information in this little book, first as to
the scientific origin and formation of the feminine portion of humanity, and next as to
woman’s limitations and powers.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Scotsman.</span>&mdash;“It is a suggestive essay on the eternal question of the Eternal Feminine,
the principal points in which problem it states with neatness and brevity, and argues out
with commendable conciseness.”</p>

<p class="book"><span class="title-it">Some Home Truths</span> re <span class="title-it">The Maori War</span>,

Fiction. By <span class="smcap">T. H. S. Escott</span>, Author of “Personal Forces
of the Period,” “Social Transformation of the Victorian Age,”
“Platform, Press, Politics, and Play,” Etc. A new and cheaper
edition. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Standard.</span>&mdash;“A book which is amusing from cover to cover. Bright epigrams abound
in Mr Escott’s satirical pictures of the modern world.… Those who know the inner
aspects of politics and society will, undoubtedly, be the first to recognise the skill and
adroitness with which he strikes at the weak places in a world of intrigue and fashion.…
There is a great deal of very clever sword-play in Mr Escott’s description of
Dum-Dum (London), the capital of Paradoxia (England).”</p>

Illustrated. Crown 8vo, cloth, 2s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Outlook.</span>&mdash;“Decidedly you should read Mr Power-Berrey’s interesting book, taking laugh
and shudder as they come.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sheffield Independent.</span>&mdash;“We do not remember to have ever seen a more popularly-written
summary of the methods of thieves than this bright and chatty volume. It is
the work of a writer who evidently has a most intimate knowledge of the criminal
classes, and who can carry on a plain narrative briskly and forcibly. The book fascinates
by its freshness and unusualness.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Liverpool Review.</span>&mdash;“This is no fanciful production, but a clear, dispassionate revelation
of the dodges of the professional criminal. Illustrated by numerous pen and ink
sketches, Mr Power-Berrey’s excellent work is useful as well as interesting, for it will
certainly not assist the common pilferer to have all his little tricks made public property
in this lucid and easily-rememberable style.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Lloyd’s.</span>&mdash;“Full of reverence, yet glows with vivid imagination.… These are Bible
stories in a most novel and attractive form, never irreverent, but full of the keenest
interest.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">British Weekly.</span>&mdash;“Among the many attempts which have recently been made to fill
out the Bible stories with the realistic touches suggested by our increased knowledge
of the conditions of life in ancient times, this anonymous volume will take a high
place. Seven stories are retold, some from the Old, some from the New Testament.
To certain tastes they may seem too elaborately wrought, the author evidently relishes
what is gorgeous, and his descriptions of Potiphar’s house are very richly inlaid with
ornament, but whatever be the judgment of readers in this respect, there can be no
question as to the effective realism of the narratives. Certainly some of the stories will
convey both to children and adults fresh and memorable conceptions of Biblical scenes.”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span>, in the course of a long and laudatory notice in <span class="review-source">Longman’s
Magazine</span>, said:&mdash;“It is a strange photograph of rude and violent life. The narrator
always carries his life in his fist. He describes, better than any other writer, the existence
of a tramp, and gives an amazing account of the brutality, and even torture, practised on
workers in some parts of the United States.… The book is as simple in style as
Swift’s writing; a kind of labouring Trelawny might have fathered these <i>adventures of
a younger son</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Richard Le Gallienne</span> (in the <span class="review-source">Idler</span>).&mdash;“‘A Man Adrift’ has held me as few
recent books have power to do. The book is ‘real’ because it has first been really lived,
and then been really written. Mr Kennedy’s book has held me, not only by its reality,
but by its courage, its pity, its humour, its all-embracing humanity, its quiet fierceness.
‘A Man Adrift’ is a brave book.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Morning Leader.</span>&mdash;“The record of an adventurous life, when well told, always appeals
to the imagination and sympathy of the reader, and ‘A Man Adrift’ is such a record.
Presumably the adventures are real; they have all the vividness of reality at all events,
and one follows the hardships and wanderings of the narrator with keen interest.…
Mr Kennedy is to be congratulated on his ‘Man Adrift.’”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">County Gentleman.</span>&mdash;“This is the book of a strong man. It has vigour, originality
and power, and comes as a refreshing change after the maudlin sentimentality of most
modern stories.… Mr Kennedy has a characteristic style. He writes in short, crisp
sentences that are at once direct and fearless. It is mainly his own story that he tells in
this strangely fascinating volume.”</p>

imaginative and picturesque. ‘In the Times to come’ is a beautiful poem, full of
suggestion, with a subtle melody of its own. How well Mr Longstaff can write is seen
in ‘A Hopeless Dawn.’ It is the work of a true poet. Mr Longstaff’s poems deserve
more extended notice. There is art in his work, and music; and his verse is full of
promise. Mr Longstaff’s muse is frank and sincere, and many of his readers will forgive

<p><span class="review-source">British Weekly.</span>&mdash;“A good story, dramatic, poetic and pathetic.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Spectator.</span>&mdash;“Madame Orzeszko paints in ‘The Modern Argonauts’ the domestic
tragedy of a successful modern millionaire with a boldness and a vigour that remind one
of Jokai. The characterisation shows the influence of modern ideas in their most

is full of humour&mdash;good humour and human nature.”</p>

successful ‘Pottle Papers’ has given the novel-reading public another ‘taste of his

as the man with a master mind and one absorbing delusion, and as such is a pathetic
figure. No one can dispute the prodigality and liveliness of the author’s imagination;
his plot teems with striking incidents.”</p>

pleasant and entertaining reading. The men and women we meet are not the men and
women we really come across in this world. So much the better for us. But we are

and humour.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Morning Post.</span>&mdash;“We must give Mr Golsworthy high praise for the way in which he
plays the game. Old hands as we are at these things, we were for a long time completely

clever, amusing character-drawing of an odd group of subsidiary folk. These are very

Every <i>sane</i> reader will wish the author success in his efforts to expose the hollowness and

will not greatly interfere with the sale of the book, which really castigates vice. We

and Joint Author of the “Silver King,” “Claudian.” Crown 8vo,

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Vanity Fair</span> says:&mdash;“The hand that wrote the ‘Silver King’ has by no means lost its
cunning in painting broad effects of light and shadow. The description of life in Broadmoor
is, we fancy, done from actual observation. It is quite new.” And the critic of
<span class="review-source">Black and White</span> sums it up pithily as “A story which holds our attention and interests
us right from the first chapter. The book is as exciting as even a story of sensation
has any need to be.” Speaking of the scene of Mr Herman’s drama, the beautiful
county of Devonshire, where the greater part of the story takes place, the <span class="review-source">Manchester
Courier</span> says: “The author’s descriptive powers vividly portray the lovely spots by the
winding Tamar, while the rich dialect of the district is so faithfully reproduced as to become
not the least feature of an exciting tale.”</p>

that truth is stranger than fiction. Crown 8vo, cloth, 3s. 6d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Liverpool Review.</span>&mdash;“A smart, anonymous novel. The story is capitally written, and
is extremely interesting. Evelyn Gray’s adventures are narrated in a style so realistic as
to leave the impression that the writer is either a medical man or one who has had very
intimate acquaintance with hospital life.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Lloyd’s.</span>&mdash;“A strong book, and one that readers will find interesting. It is undoubtedly
clever and well written.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Graphic.</span>&mdash;“The characters are cleverly drawn, and the revelations of hospital
life, of private nursing, and of the manners and customs of the ‘celibate’ clergy should
ensure the volume considerable popularity.”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">St James’s Gazette.</span>&mdash;“We have read the book from start to finish with unflagging
interest&mdash;an interest, by the way, which derives nothing from the ‘spice,’ for though its

The literary style is good.”</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Douglas Sladen</span> in <span class="review-source">The Queen</span>.&mdash;“A remarkably clever book.… There is no
disputing the ability with which the writer handles her subject. I say <i>her</i> subject,
because the minuteness of the touches, and the odd, forcible style in which this book is
written, point to it being the work of a female hand. The book is an eminently readable
one, and it is never dull for a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">The Monitor.</span>&mdash;“A wonderful piece of writing. The only modern parallel we can find
is supplied in Mr F. C. Philipps’s ‘As in a Looking Glass.’”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Whitehall Review.</span>&mdash;“In ‘The Green Passion’ the author traces with much ability,
and not a little analytical insight, the progress of jealousy in the breast of a woman who
is born with a very ‘intense,’ although not a very deep, nature.… There is in Mr
Vert’s work a certain tendency towards realism which has its due effect in making his
characters real. They are no loosely-built fancies of the journalistic brain, but portraits&mdash;almost
snapshot portraits&mdash;of men and women of to-day.”</p>

a wonderful enthusiasm, usually the attribute of youth. ‘Drifting’ is a very fresh and

entertainment in Mr W. P. Kelly’s new story. In the way of accessories to
startling situations all is fish that comes to this ingenious author’s net. The wonders of
primitive nature, the marvels of latter-day science, the extravagances of human passion&mdash;all
these he dexterously uses for the purpose of involving his hero in perilous scrapes from
which he no less dexterously extricates him by expedients which, however far-fetched
they may appear to the unimaginative, are certainly not lacking in originality of device
or cleverness of construction.… This is a specimen incident&mdash;those which succeed it
derive their special interest from the action of Rontgen rays, subterranean torrents, and

<p><span class="review-source">Public Opinion.</span>&mdash;“A remarkable book.… We are plunged into a delicious and
tantalising romance; incident follows incident like a panorama of exciting pictures.
Fertility of imagination is everywhere apparent, and the <i>dénouement</i> is artfully
concealed till it bursts upon the reader with a suddenness that fairly takes away his
breath.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Liverpool Post.</span>&mdash;“A very skilfully-constructed story, mysterious and strange, with a
natural explanation suggested of all the mystery which does not spoil one’s enjoyment
(here follows analysis of plot). This is the bare outline of the story up to a certain point;
it is impossible to convey adequately an idea of the awe-inspiring characteristics of the

<p><span class="review-source">Saturday Review.</span>&mdash;“The great novel-reading public, which found ‘The Hypocrite’
to its taste, will not be disappointed in the author’s latest effort. The writer has a knack
of character-presentment which means that his people live; he has a dramatic instinct;

life well; and his story is original enough to hold the interest throughout.”</p>

epigrams begin exploding and the repartee detonating, and the subtle terse and quart of

this coruscation is kept up in a way to make your hair curl until the end of the story.…
The author has abundant literary aptitudes, exemplified over and over again by the pages

<p><span class="review-source">Daily Telegraph.</span>&mdash;“A book by an anonymous author always arouses a certain inquiry,
and when the book is clever and original the interest becomes keen, and conjecture is rife,
endowing the most unlikely people with authorship.… It is very brilliant, very
forcible, very sad.… It is perfect in its way, in style clear, sharp and forcible, the

<p><span class="review-source">Literature.</span>&mdash;“The story strikes the fresh note of having been lived, experienced, and
does not come to one as a stale invention. There is human nature in it, and passion,
of a kind: tragedy too.… We should say, ‘Read the book by all means.’”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Echo.</span>&mdash;“Its general air of out-Bourget-ing Bourget. You will ‘see life’ in its story, no
doubt, for it has a measure of pathos, insight and power, but most certainly you will not
see life steadily.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">M. A. P.</span>&mdash;“Very light and dainty in its tone. ‘In Monte Carlo’ is a typical example of
the work of the great Polish writer.… It is the old, old tale of a man with a maid&mdash;plus

<p><span class="review-source">Pall Mall Gazette.</span>&mdash;“It is beyond all question the work of a great artist. It is
subtly analytical and psychologically true. So triumphant is the art of the Polish novelist
that we follow the story with lively sympathy and unflagging interest.… It is always
interesting; the clear, able and convincing portrayal of the two leading characters gives
the book its chief value. There are wise sayings and occasional epigrams, and the
thumbnail sketches of Mrs Elsen’s lovers are wholly admirable.”</p>

‘John Basileon’ evinces imagination and subtlety of a highly vivid and intense quality.
The note of the book is modern, but of a modernity far removed from that of the term

<p><span class="review-source">Standard.</span>&mdash;“There are many pleasant pages in ‘Fame, the Fiddler,’ which reminds
us of ‘Trilby,’ with its pictures of Bohemian life, and its happy-go-lucky group of good-hearted,
generous scribblers, artists and playwrights. Some of the characters are so true
to life that it is impossible not to recognise them. Among the best incidents in the
volume must be mentioned the production of Pryor’s play, and the account of poor
Jimmy Lambert’s death, which is as moving an incident as we have read for a long
time. Altogether, ‘Fame, the Fiddler’ is a very human book, and an amusing one
as well.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Lady.</span>&mdash;“A thrilling romance with a mediæval atmosphere, although the scene is laid

<p><span class="review-source">Vanity Fair.</span>&mdash;“The author has a peculiar knowledge of the ‘Halls’ and those who
frequent them; and especially, as it seems to us, of those Jewish persons who sometimes
run them. And he has made good use of his knowledge here. But there is more than
this in the book; for ‘George Martyn’ has considerable descriptive talent. His account,
for instance, of the fight between the hero and the butcher is quite good. The story is

painful incidents in the book, which is interesting from beginning to end.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Aberdeen Free Press.</span>&mdash;“Mrs Bradshaw has written several good novels, and the
outstanding feature of all of them has been her skilful development of plot, and her tasteful,
pleasing style. In connection with the present story we are able to amply reiterate
those praises. The plot again is well developed and logically carried out, while the
language used by the authoress is always happy and well chosen, and never commonplace.…

quality of <i>grip</i> in a greater degree than is the case with ‘Death and the Woman.’…
Every page of every chapter develops the interest, which culminates in one of the most
sensational <i>dénouements</i> it has been our lot to read. The flavour of actuality is not
destroyed by any incredible incident; it is the inevitable thing that always happens.
‘Death and the Woman’ will supply to the brim the need of those in search of a holding

The characters are real men and women, and not the sentimental and
artificial puppets to which we have been so long accustomed by our sensationalists. The

<p><span class="review-source">The Referee.</span>&mdash;“Another little humorous book is ‘That Fascinating Widow,’ by Mr S.
J. Adair Fitz-Gerald, who can be very funny when he tries. The story which gives the
title to the book would make a capital farce. ‘The Blue-blooded Coster’ is an amusing
piece of buffoonery.”</p>

the possessor of a store of humour, on which he has again drawn for the furnishing of the
little volume he has just put together. Among the tales included are several which might
be suitable for reading or recitation, and none which are dull. Mr Fitz-Gerald frankly
addresses himself to that portion of the public which desires nothing so much as to be
amused, and likes even its amusements in small doses. Such a public will entertain itself
very pleasantly with Mr Fitz-Gerald’s lively tales, and will probably name as its favourites
those titled ‘Pure Cussedness,’ ‘Splidgings’ First Baby,’ and ‘The Blue-blooded Coster.’”</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="review-source">Sheffield Daily Telegraph.</span>&mdash;“Anyone who wants a good laugh should get ‘The
Pottle Papers.’ They are very droll reading for an idle afternoon, or picking up at
any time when ‘down in the dumps.’ They are very brief and very bright, and it is
impossible for anyone with the slightest sense of humour to read the book without
bursting into ‘the loud guffaw’ which does not always ‘bespeak the empty mind.’”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Pall Mall Gazette.</span>&mdash;“It contains plenty of boisterous humour of the Max Adeler
kind … humour that is genuine and spontaneous. The author, for all his antics, has
a good deal more in him than the average buffoon. There is, for example, a very clever
and subtle strain of feeling running through the comedy in ‘The Love that Burned’&mdash;a
rather striking bit of work. Mr Raven Hill’s illustrations are as amusing as they
always are.”</p>

<p><b>DAN LENO, HYS BOOKE</b>, is, says the <span class="review-source">Liverpool Review</span>, “the funniest publication

<p>This enormously successful book of genuine and spontaneous humour has been received

<p><span class="review-source">Lloyd’s.</span>&mdash;“One long laugh from start to finish.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">St Paul’s.</span>&mdash;“It is very funny.”</p>

<p>These are a few opinions taken at random from hundreds of notices.</p>

<p>Says the <span class="review-source">Daily News</span> (Hull):&mdash;“The funniest book we have read for some time. You
must perforce scream with huge delight at the dry sayings and writings of the funny
little man who has actually killed people with his patter and his antics. Page after page

<p><span class="review-source">Weekly Sun.</span>&mdash;“These ‘Bachelor Ballads’ are excellent fun.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Literary World.</span>&mdash;“The book is good from beginning to end, and its excellent illustrations
by John Hassall are fittingly humorous.”</p>

<p><span class="review-source">Sheffield Independent.</span>&mdash;“It is a rare thing to find humour in rhyme without vulgarity,
and fun without feebleness. One is, as a rule, inclined to laugh too rarely with
the joking poet, and sigh often at the pity of his hideous staleness. Mr Spurr is the
exception. His unostentatious rhymes abound in neat literary turns, brim with good
humour, and jig to a natural sprightliness. He can pass, too, the test of persistent
punning without causing the gorge of the reader to rise. In brief, he is a really humorous
versifier, and the illustrator of his work has happily caught his spirit. A man who can
turn out in thirty-two lines twenty-five puns on cricket, and work in a love story too, may
be regarded as having shouldered the mantle of Hood.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
